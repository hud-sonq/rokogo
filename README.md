### (work-in-progress) A short python script to pseudo-daemon ngrok tunnels and list the needed ip and ports
### Useful when deploying several apps at once with ngrok

##### ~~Here is an example config which creates two tunels, one for SSH and one for a Minecraft server:~~

```ngrok.yml``` Config creation loop added (work in progress)
